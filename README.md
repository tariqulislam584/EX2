# Kotlin Higher-Order Functions Practice

This repository contains a simple Kotlin program demonstrating the use of **higher-order functions** on a collection of integers.

## Program Goal

The goal was to practice chaining and applying `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` (or `fold`) functions in Kotlin.

## Implementation Details

1.  A list of integers from 1 to 50 is generated.
2.  The `filter` function is used to extract all **even numbers**.
3.  The `map` function is then applied to the resulting list of even numbers to calculate the **square** of each number.
4.  Finally, the `reduce` function is used to calculate the **sum** of all these squared even numbers.

The results of each step (Evens, Squares, and the final Sum) are printed to the console with clear labels.
